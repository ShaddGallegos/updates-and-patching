# Updates and Patching Automation

This repository contains Ansible roles and playbooks for automating system updates, security patching, and maintenance across your infrastructure.

## Overview

The Updates and Patching framework provides a standardized, automated approach to system maintenance with:

- Consistent patching procedures across environments
- Pre and post-update validation
- Scheduled or on-demand execution options
- Detailed reporting and logging
- Support for different operating systems

## Roles

### system_assessment

Evaluates systems before patching to determine update requirements and potential risks.

**Key tasks:**

- Package update availability check
- Disk space verification
- Service dependency mapping
- Security vulnerability scanning

### update_packages

Handles the core package update process across different operating systems.

**Key tasks:**

- Repository refresh
- Package updates (security or all)
- Package cleanup
- Update logging

### reboot_management

Controls system restart procedures with proper notifications and verification.

**Key tasks:**

- Pre-reboot notifications
- Coordinated reboot sequencing
- Post-reboot availability monitoring
- Service recovery automation

### verification

Validates system health and functionality after updates.

**Key tasks:**

- Service status verification
- Application health checks
- Performance baseline comparison
- Monitoring system reintegration

### reporting

Generates comprehensive reports on patching activities.

**Key tasks:**

- Update summary creation
- Failed update identification
- Compliance status reporting
- Report distribution

## Playbooks

### security_patching.yml

Applies security updates only, minimizing service disruption.

**Usage:** `ansible-playbook security_patching.yml -i inventory`

### full_system_update.yml

Comprehensive system update including all available package updates.

**Usage:** `ansible-playbook full_system_update.yml -i inventory`

### emergency_patch.yml

Targeted patching for specific CVEs or vulnerabilities with minimal delay.

**Usage:** `ansible-playbook emergency_patch.yml -i inventory -e "cve=CVE-2023-12345"`

### maintenance_window.yml

Orchestrates complete maintenance activities including updates, reboots, and verification within defined maintenance windows.

**Usage:** `ansible-playbook maintenance_window.yml -i inventory -e "maintenance_window=true"`

## Configuration

The framework can be configured through variables in:

- `group_vars/all.yml` - Global default settings
- `group_vars/<group>.yml` - Environment-specific configurations
- `host_vars/<hostname>.yml` - Host-specific overrides

### Key Variables

```yaml
# Update scope
security_only: true                # Only apply security updates
update_kernel: true                # Include kernel updates

# Reboot behavior
reboot_if_needed: true             # Automatically reboot when required
reboot_timeout: 1800               # Max time to wait for reboot completion

# Notifications
notify_start: true                 # Send notification before starting
notification_email: "ops@example.com"

# Prerequisites
- Ansible 2.12 or newer
- SSH access to target systems
- Appropriate sudo/privilege escalation
- Package manager access on targets
- Getting Started
- Clone this repository
- Configure your inventory
- Review and modify default variables
- Run the desired playbook

## Example:
# Test connectivity
ansible -i inventory all -m ping

# Run security patching with custom notification
"ansible-playbook -i inventory security_patching.yml -e "notification_email=admin@example.com""
