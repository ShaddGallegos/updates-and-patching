- AlmaLinux 8/9
- Fedora (limited support)

## Quick Usage

### Basic Update Operations

```bash
# Register systems with RHN/Satellite
ansible-playbook rhel_register_rhn.yml

# Run general updating procedures
cd General_Updating/
ansible-playbook update_systems.yml

# Use with inventory
ansible-playbook -i inventory update_playbook.yml
```

### Satellite Integration

```bash
# Navigate to satellite management
cd satellite/

# Run satellite-specific update operations
ansible-playbook satellite_patch_management.yml
```

### Demo and Testing

```bash
# Use demo inventory for testing
ansible-playbook -i inventory_demo test_updates.yml
```

## Directory Structure

- **General_Updating/** - Standard system update procedures
- **satellite/** - Red Hat Satellite specific operations
- **roles/** - Reusable Ansible roles for update operations
- **group_vars/** - Environment and group-specific variables
- **scripts/** - Utility scripts and helpers
- **templates/** - Configuration templates

## Limitations

- Requires Red Hat subscription for RHEL systems
- Satellite integration requires Red Hat Satellite infrastructure
- Network connectivity required for repository access
- May require system reboots and maintenance windows
- Resource-intensive operations may impact system performance
- Some updates may require manual intervention

## Getting Help

### Documentation

- Check individual role documentation in roles/ directory
- Review group_vars/ for configuration examples
- Examine scripts/ directory for utility tools
- Review templates/ for configuration file examples

### Support Resources

- Red Hat documentation for patch management best practices
- Ansible documentation for playbook development
- Red Hat Satellite documentation for integration details
- Use ansible-playbook --check for dry-run validation

### Common Issues

- Subscription management: Ensure valid Red Hat subscriptions
- Network connectivity: Verify access to update repositories
- Dependency conflicts: Review package dependencies before updates
- Service disruption: Plan maintenance windows appropriately
- Storage space: Ensure sufficient disk space for updates
- Rollback planning: Test rollback procedures before production updates

### Best Practices

- Always test updates in development environments first
- Schedule updates during appropriate maintenance windows
- Monitor system performance during update operations
- Maintain current backups before major updates
- Document all update procedures and results
- Validate system functionality after updates
